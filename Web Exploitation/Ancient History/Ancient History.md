# Ancient History

## Description

I must have been sleep hacking or something, I don't remember visiting all of these sites... [http://mercury.picoctf.net:52731/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:52731/) (try a couple different browsers if it's not working right)

## Hints

1. What kind of information can JavaScript modify?
2. If you want to do this the un-fun way, the obfuscation is pretty lazy.

## Approach

Haha I probably did this the "un-fun" way. First upon inspecting the page, I realized there's a lot of JavaScript [*stuff*](https://github.com/v341196137/PicoCTF2021-Writeup/blob/main/Web+Exploitation/Ancient+History/stuff.js).

...as you can see... that's a lot of *stuff*.
I noticed some commands that look like:

```js
window.history.pushState({urlpath:'/index.html?p'}, "", '/index.html?p');
```

The `?p` is the first character in "picoCTF". By manually searching for "url" and assembling the characters together one by one, the flag can be obtained.

## Flag
